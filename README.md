I created my AWS account by using My Github username and a random password, saved both into the account and filled in the rest of it. While setting up the AWS account, I went over to get my IAM account set up so that I could create a budget. I noticed that there was a sign-in url, I clicked it and it took me to the sign in page for the account, nothing like the creating account site. When i tried to go back, they logged me out. So i try to sign back in, the password wasn't working at first, then i saw there was a two routes to sign in, so i picked the one to my email and i got back in and created my budget.
I think the one key insight I have about DynamoDB is how self reliant it is to simply not need any servers for updates on the user's workload
